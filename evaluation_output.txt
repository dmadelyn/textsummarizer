I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.

This was a fairly interesting read.  It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get  to read a story that doesn't have coarse, crasslanguage.  I read for fun and relaxation......I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing,innovative, and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language.

I'd never read any of the Amy Brewster mysteries until this one..  So I am really hooked on them now.

If you like period pieces - clothing, lingo, you will enjoy this mystery.  Author had me guessing at least 2/3 of the way through.

A beautiful in-depth character description makes it like a fast pacing movie. It is a pity Mr Merwin did not write 30 instead only 3 of the Amy Brewster mysteries.
