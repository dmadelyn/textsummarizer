The goal is to effectively summarize large bodies of text into concise, meaningful summaries.\n","\n","## Description\n","\n","In this project, we are exploring different approaches to text summarization:\n","- Summarizing each paragraph individually and then stitching these summaries together.\n","- Summarizing the entire text in one go.\n","\n","We will compare these methods using ROUGE scores to evaluate their effectiveness.\n","\n","## Steps to Run\n","\n","1. **Add Data to the Runtime (IMPORTANT!)**: I'd say the first thing would be to add the data to the runtime on the side column. For us, we shoudl add the kindle_reviews.csv as well as the test.jsonl. Put both of those in the runtime, no need for folder nesting, etc. Should be sufficient as is.\n","\n","2. **Install Required Libraries**: First cell will install libraries. We are using PyTorch for this.\n","\n","3. **Model Fine-Tuning**: The model then creates a class that will prepare the summaries such that they are in a format to be fed in. In other words, we can't just input text, you have to show it that it's a text / summary pair so T5 knows.\n","\n","4. **Text Summarization**: In this section, we apply the fine-tuned model to summarize the test data. The two approaches (paragraph-by-paragraph and full-text summarization) are implemented and compared. Results are saved to an array. The last one is printed out for idk sanity I guess.\n","\n","5. **Evaluate Summaries**: The summaries generated by each method are evaluated using the ROUGE metric just imported easily. The results are displayed and compared to determine the more effective approach. Here is kinda a summary of what they can mean -\n","\n","Recall essentially answers the following question - \"Of all the relevent information present in the initial summary, how much did the generated summary manage to capture\"\n","\n","Precision answers the following question - \"Of all the information presented in the generated summary, how much of it is relevant or actually appears in the reference summary?\"\n","\n","## Notes\n","\n","One thing to be concerned about is the rapid amount of paragraphs... that's why I added the average paragraph to make sure it was spitting out something reasonable.\n","\n","Pretraining & actually predicting take a long time, so just be wary of that when running. I think that it takes around 10 seconds generally speaking to make a prediction and the training output it shown but it took me 4.5 minutes for say 1000 summaries."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":11884,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703272259586,"user":{"displayName":"Tanay
